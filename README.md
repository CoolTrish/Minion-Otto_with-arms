# Minion-Otto_with-arms
Remix of OttoDIY to include arms and control by infrared remote control

You will find a sketch and libraries to used for controlling your Otto with arms with a infrared remote control (Tolako remote kit) from ebay or amazon, these libraries are separate to the Ottodiy+ Github repository due to their changes to main libraries. 

NOTE: replace any Otto libraries you may have with these libraries to allow sketches to compile.
